Fluid mechanics dictionary
==========================

Even after a few years of experience, I still occasionally run across unknown
words when reading articles or reports.  I often wished that I had a single
comprehensive dictionary that could define technical terms in fluid mechanics.
To that end, I decided to slowly create that kind of dictionary.  This is a
long-term personal project, so I do not expect any "working product" in the
meanwhile, but I nonetheless hope that one day I have accumulated enough to
make the effort worthwhile.
